# Module 10: SQL Alchemy Challenge

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.

## Part 1: Analyse and Explore the Climate Data

In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, you’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. ``SurfsUp/climate.ipynb``

## Part 2: Design Your Climate App

Now that you’ve completed your initial analysis, you’ll design a Flask API based on the queries developed on part 1. ``SurfsUp/app.py``
